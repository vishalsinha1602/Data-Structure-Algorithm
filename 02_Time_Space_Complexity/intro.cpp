//! What is Time Complexity??
//? The rate at which the time, required to run a code, changes with respect to the input size, is considered the time complexity.
//> Basically, the time complexity of a particular code depends on the given input size, not on the machine used to run the code.

//! Time complexity =! Time taken

//! 10^8 operation completed in 1 sec.

//! Dependent on input size only.

//! To represent the time complexity, we generally use the Big O notation. O(time taken)

//* Time complexity to be computed in worst case scenerio
//! avoid constant
//! avoid lower values

//? best case ,average=> pcase(best+worst)/2 and worst case

//? Big-h(o)->worst_case[upper_bond]
//? theta-> average complexity
//? omega-> lowest bond

//* space complexity -> memory space that a program take

//* BigO()

//* auxilliarly space=>space that you take to solve the probelm + input space => the space that you take to store the input
